## Steps

Here are the steps for creating a website with search functionality, HTML structure, CSS design, responsive CSS, and JavaScript animation:

1. **Planning and Research**
   - Identify the purpose and goals of this project.
   - Research existing reference websites that offer material and features similar.
   - Make notes using plain paper of the features, layout, and design elements that i found appealing and could incorporate into this project.

2. **HTML Structure**
   - Create the basic structure of your HTML file using the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration and the `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
   - Include necessary meta tags, such as character encoding and viewport settings.
   - Define the overall layout structure of this site using appropriate HTML elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, etc.
   - Implement the search functionality by adding an input field and a button inside of navigation bar.

3. **Designing with CSS**
   - Create a separate CSS file and link it to  HTML file using the `<link>` tag.
   - Start by defining the general styles for the website, such as font families, font sizes, colors, and backgrounds.
   - Use CSS selectors to target specific HTML elements and apply styles to them.
   - Utilize CSS classes and IDs to style individual elements or groups of elements as needed.
   - Apply layout styles using CSS flexbox or CSS grid to create a visually appealing structure.
   - Style the search input field and button to match desired design.
   - Experiment with different styles, colors, and layouts to achieve the desired look and feel.

4. **Responsive CSS**
   - Implement responsive design techniques to ensure website looks good and functions well on different screen sizes and devices.
   - Use CSS media queries to define specific styles for different screen widths.
   - Consider adjusting the layout, font sizes, margins, and paddings to optimize the website's responsiveness.
   - Test the website on various devices and screen sizes to ensure it adapts correctly.

5. **JavaScript Animation**
   - Add interactivity and animation effects to the website using JavaScript.
   - Use JavaScript to handle user interactions, such as submitting the search form or filtering search results.
   - Implement animations using libraries like CSS animations, jQuery, or JavaScript animation frameworks.
   - Apply transitions, fades, slides, or other animation effects to enhance the user experience.
   - Test and fine-tune the animations to ensure they work smoothly and don't negatively impact performance.
